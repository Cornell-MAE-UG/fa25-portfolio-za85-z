For ENGRD 2020 class, we were given a 2D design space of 150cm long and 50cm tall, and were asked to design a mechanism that can lift the maximum possible weight to the highest possible height. The following elements must be used: a rigid bar of a fixed length, 3 pin supports, two of which mounted on the ground, and a linear
actuator from the Tolomatic catalog.

This is the design:
